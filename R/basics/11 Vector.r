# Vectors
# Creating vectors
# Vectors can store only same type of variable

a
typeof(a)

b <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) # All double
b
typeof(b)
class(b)

c <- c("hello", "Hola", "Hye", "Halo") # All Characters
c
typeof(c)
class(c)

# If one is character all are converted in character
d <- c(1, 2.4, "Kunwar", 4 + 9i)

# Create sequence of numbers in a vector

e
class(e)

# Create a sequence which is incremented by some number

# Must have equal no. of element in vectors

i

j

k

l <- g / h # Division
l

# Sorting vectors
g

h

i

# Indexing
i

i[c(2, 5)] # Access more than one element by its position

i[c(T, T, F, F, T)] # Access element by logical operators T
i[c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)]

i[i > 8] # We can access index with condition

i
i[-1] # Access all element by skipping the negetive index

i[c(-2, -4)] # Access all element by skipping the negetive index

i[3] <- 15 # Modify an element in the vector
i

i <- NULL # Deleting all element from vector
i

rm(i) # Delete variable i
